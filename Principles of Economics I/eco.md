## 1. Introduction to Economics
- **Definition**: Study of how individuals and societies allocate scarce resources.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - Scarcity: Limited nature of society's resources.
    - Opportunity Cost: The next best alternative foregone when making a decision.
    - Marginal Analysis: Examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity.
- **Branches of Economics**:
    - Microeconomics: Study of individual and business decision-making.
    - Macroeconomics: Study of the economy as a whole, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth.

## 2. Supply and Demand
- **Law of Demand**: As price decreases, quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus.
- **Law of Supply**: As price increases, quantity supplied increases, ceteris paribus.
- **Equilibrium**: Point where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded.
- **Shifts in Demand and Supply**:
    - Factors affecting demand: income, tastes, prices of related goods, expectations, number of buyers.
    - Factors affecting supply: production technology, input prices, expectations, number of sellers.

## 3. Elasticity
- **Price Elasticity of Demand**: Measure of how much quantity demanded responds to a change in price, calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.
- **Income Elasticity**: Measure of how much quantity demanded responds to a change in consumer income, calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.
- **Cross-Price Elasticity**: Measure of how much quantity demanded of one good responds to a change in the price of another good, calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded of the first good divided by the percentage change in price of the second good.

## 4. Consumer Behavior
- **Utility**: Satisfaction or pleasure derived from consuming goods and services.
- **Budget Constraint**: Limit on the consumption bundles that a consumer can afford, given their income and the prices of goods and services.
- **Indifference Curves**: Graphical representation of different bundles of goods between which a consumer is indifferent, showing combinations of goods that provide the same level of utility.
- **Consumer Choice**: Decision-making process of selecting the best bundle of goods that maximizes utility subject to the budget constraint.

## 5. Production and Costs
- **Production Function**: Relationship between the quantity of inputs used in production and the quantity of output produced.
- **Costs**:
    - Fixed Costs: Costs that do not vary with the level of output.
    - Variable Costs: Costs that vary directly with the level of output.
    - Total Costs: Sum of fixed and variable costs.
    - Marginal Cost: Additional cost of producing one more unit of output.
    - Average Cost: Total cost divided by the number of units produced.
- **Economies of Scale**: Cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale.

## 6. Market Structures
- **Perfect Competition**: Market structure characterized by many firms, identical products, and free entry and exit.
- **Monopoly**: Market structure where a single firm controls the entire market, producing a unique product with no close substitutes.
- **Oligopoly**: Market structure with a few firms that may produce similar or identical products, often leading to strategic interactions among firms.
- **Monopolistic Competition**: Market structure with many firms that sell products that are similar but not identical, allowing for product differentiation.
- **Barriers to Entry**: Obstacles that make it difficult for new firms to enter a market, such as high startup costs, regulatory requirements, and strong brand loyalty.

## 7. Macroeconomics Overview
- **GDP**: Gross Domestic Product, the total value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.
- **Inflation**: Rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, eroding purchasing power.
- **Unemployment**: Measure of the number of people actively looking for a job but unable to find one, often expressed as a percentage of the labor force.
- **Fiscal Policy**: Government adjustments to spending levels and tax rates to influence the economy.
- **Monetary Policy**: Central bank actions that determine the size and rate of growth of the money supply, primarily through interest rates.

## 8. International Trade
- **Comparative Advantage**: Ability of a country to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, leading to specialization and trade.
- **Trade Barriers**: Government-imposed regulations such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies that restrict or promote international trade.
- **Exchange Rates**: Value of one currency for the purpose of conversion to another, influencing international trade and investment.

## 9. Public Economics
- **Public Goods**: Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning they can be consumed by many people without reducing the amount available to others.
- **Externalities**: Costs or benefits that affect third parties who are not involved in the economic transaction, leading to market failure.
- **Taxation**: System of raising money to fund government expenditures, affecting income distribution and resource allocation.

## 10. Economic Growth
- **Factors of Growth**: Capital, labor, technology, and other inputs that contribute to the increase in output over time.
- **Growth Models**: Theories that explain how economic growth occurs, including the Solow growth model and endogenous growth theory.
- **Sustainable Development**: Economic development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, emphasizing environmental protection and resource conservation.
